GIT COMMANDS AND STEPS PROCESS:

* Initialize new Git repository:

1.git init | new Git directory inside current folder
2.git remote add origin <repository_url> | connect local repository (work folder) to remote repository in GitHub


* Git Branch

git branch -M main | rename branch to "main"
git branch | check status connection

Stagig Area / Index

git add example.txt | add single file to stagig area
git add . | add all changed files from working directory
git add * .py | stage files with specific extension

Commited files

git commit -m <"message here"> | in order to make first commit, must be added first file

Miscs 

git status | check current repository

* Staged files are ready to be committed.
* Unstaged files are not yet ready to be committed.
* Untracked files are new files that Git has not seen before.

| link local to remote branch so future push commands will automatically apply to this branch
| after this, it will be just require add the command <git push>

git push -u origin main
